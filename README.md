# security-nightmare
A demo for a talk on web-security. **Don't deploy this app. EVER!**

This web-app consists of two HTTP servers listening to `:666` and `:777`.

* `:666` – the most insecure blog post feed ever created by the humanity. Does not escape anything, so there are plenty ways to exploit it.
* `:777` – a demo server needed for CSRF and `window.opener` attacks.

By default, the feed database is pre-filled with examples which can give you some guidance.

## Run

You have to install [go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) in order to build and run it.

Then to start shooting your legs is simple as:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com
git clone git@github.com:rdner/security-nightmare.git
cd security-nightmare
make run
```
